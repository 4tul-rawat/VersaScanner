# VersaScanner

A security tool that performs scans on a target using OpenVAS, Zap, and Nexpose, then compiles and combines the scan findings.

The current capability of this tool is to use OWASP ZAP APIs to scan targets and report the vulnerabilites on the host. The next step is to combine the capabilities of OWASP Zap, OpenVAS and Nexpose altogther to make one utility to scan the target.
